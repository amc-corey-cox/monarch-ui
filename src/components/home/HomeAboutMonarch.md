<h3> Connecting phenotypes to genotypes across species </h3>
    <div class="description">
        The Monarch Initiative is an integrative data and analytic platform connecting phenotypes to genotypes across species, 
        bridging basic and applied research with semantics-based analysis. The correlation of phenotypic outcomes and disease 
        with genetic variation and environmental factors is a core pursuit in biology and biomedicine.
